## Dcoumenting your script
Some say that good code is self-explanatory, there is no need for extra information. Although we should do our best to write clean and clear code, it can only show how it does something, not why! 

### Comments 
Comments are needed to add that extra information which will help someone reading the code later to understand the whole picture.
~~~
valid = False
# Loop until the user enters a valid number
while not valid:
    num = int(input('Enter a number between 1 and 10: '))
    if num >= 1 and num <= 10:
        valid = True
    else:
        print('invalid, try again')
~~~

### Docstrings
Python documentation strings (or docstrings) are a way of documenting Python functions (and modules). A docsting is defined as a string on the first statement in the function code should describe what the function does, not how. It is good practice to use docstrings with all your functions. Docstrings can be accessed at runtime byusing the __doc__ attribute.

The doc string line should begin with a capital letter and end with a period. 
~~~
def dcoumentedFunction():
    ''' The first line should be a short description.

    More details can be added after skipping a line.
    '''
    five = 4 + 1
  
print (dcoumentedFunction.__doc__)
~~~
