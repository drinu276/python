## First Python script
The script below is the simplest script ou can write in Python. Save it to a .py file and run it.
~~~
print("Welcome to Python.")
~~~

## Variable data types
Variables are used to store different types of data in memory that can be referenced and modified in a script. Variables are given a descriptive name to make scripts more readable. It is helpful to think of variables as containers that hold information.

### Integers
An integer (int) is a whole number, e.g.: 9. In Python 3, there is practically no limit to how long an integer value can be.
~~~
age = 30
print(age)
~~~

### Floating-Point Numbers
A floating-point number (float) is a number with a decimal point, e.g.: 33.65
~~~
price = 9.99
print(price)
~~~

### Booleans
A Boolean (bool) is a data type tha may have one of two values, True or False:
~~~
canRunFast = True
canJumpHigh = False
~~~

### Strings
A String (str) is sequences of characters. Strings may be delimited using either single or double quotes. All the characters between the opening delimiter and matching closing delimiter are part of the string.
~~~
aString = 'Here is a string'
print(aString)
anotherString = "Here's another one"
print(anotherString)
~~~

## Working with variables
### Mathematical operations
~~~
one = 1
ten = 15 - 5
eleven = one + ten
~~~

Can you guess what the following code will print out?
~~~
number = 10
number += 5
print(number)
~~~

### Combining strings (concatenation)
~~~
createdBy = "Python was created by"
guido = "Guido van Rossum"
sentence = createdBy + " " + guido
print(sentence)
~~~

### Formatting output 
It is possible to print a number of varaibles at one go (separated be a space)
~~~
seven = 7
twoAndHalf = 2.5
hello = "hello"

# This will work!
print(seven, twoAndHalf, hello)

# This will not work!
# print(seven + twoAndHalf + hello)
# TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'int' and 'str'

#Fix 
print(str(seven) + str(twoAndHalf) + hello)
~~~

### Advanced output formatting
~~~
print("Integer: %d" % seven)
print("Float: %f" % twoAndHalf)
print("String: %s" % hello)
~~~

Floating point numbers can be rounded before printing 

~~~
print("%d %.2f %s" % (seven, twoAndHalf, hello))
~~~

## Lists and similar structures

### Tuples
Tuples are a list of values e.g. the months of the year, and like other varaibles they are given a name. It is possible to access the items in a tuple using the index number starting from 0. In months 0=Jan, 1=Feb and so on. What is the output of the following scripts?
~~~
months = ('Jan','Feb','Mar','Apr','May','Jun','Jul','Aug','Sep','Oct','Nov','Dec')
print(months[6]) 
~~~

### Lists
Lists are very similar to tuples, with the only difference being that the entries can be modified. Notice the square brackets instead of normal brackets below.
~~~
toys = ['Car', 'doll', 'ball', 'rope']
print(toys)
print (toys[2])
~~~

To add a new toy to our list, use the `append()` function. To remove a toy use the `remove()` function. We will be discussing functions later on in the course...
~~~
toys.append('Playstation')
print(toys)
toys.remove('rope')
print(toys)
~~~
