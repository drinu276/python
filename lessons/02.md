## First Python script
The script below is the simplest script ou can write in Python. Save it to a .py file and run it.
~~~
print("Welcome to Python.")
~~~

## Variable data types
Variables are used to store different types of data in memory that can be referenced and modified in a script. Variables are given a descriptive name to make scripts more readable. It is helpful to think of variables as containers that hold information.

### Integers
An integer (int) is a whole number, e.g.: 9. In Python 3, there is practically no limit to how long an integer value can be.
~~~
age = 30
print(age)
~~~

### Floating-Point Numbers
A floating-point number (float) is a number with a decimal point, e.g.: 33.65
~~~
price = 9.99
print(price)
~~~

### Booleans
A Boolean (bool) is a data type tha may have one of two values, True or False:
~~~
canRunFast = True
canJumpHigh = False
~~~

### Strings
A String (str) is sequences of characters. Strings may be delimited using either single or double quotes. All the characters between the opening delimiter and matching closing delimiter are part of the string.
~~~
aString = 'Here is a string'
print(aString)
anotherString = "Here's another one"
print(anotherString)
~~~
