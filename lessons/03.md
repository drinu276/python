## IF statements (conditions)
The simplest control scturcture is the if statement, which executes code depending a condition being true or false. Every condition line ends with a colon. The statements that depend on the condition are indented (spaces or tabe). Consider the following sample:
~~~
examMark = 68

if examMark >= 50:
    print("Pass")
else:
    print("Fail")
~~~

### Multiple conditions using Elif (else if)
~~~
if balance < 0:
    print("Trouble!")
elif balance == 0:
    print("Start saving")
else:
    print("There is something")
~~~

### Task: BMI calculator
Create a Python script that:
1. Asks the user to enter weight in Kg and height in Metres
1. Calculates the BMI using weight / (height * height)
1. Prints out the appropriate category according to the following ranges:
   * less than 18.5 = underweight
   * 18.5–24.9 = normal weight
   * 25–29.9 = overweight
   * 30 or higher = obese
